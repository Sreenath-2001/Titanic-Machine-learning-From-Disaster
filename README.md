# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

##  Objective
To predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models based on features such as age, gender, class, and more.

---

##  Overview
This project is a classic from Kaggle's "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling to understand which passengers were more likely to survive the tragic sinking of the Titanic.
